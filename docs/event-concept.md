# Introducing Concept of Event(or Community Run)#

The application would become much more relevant to the conference organisers if we introduce the concept of events. An organiser can create an event by providing few mandatory fields. The event would then will have its own page. 

## Impact of this change##

1. The current index page will become irrelevant if we introduce the concept of event as there is no mention of events in the index page. The stats that we show on the index page would become stats of the event page.

2. There would be one page per event. It should have join button and show relevant stats.

3. How to differentiate between individual goals and events? The better name would be community run or group run.

4. What should home page show? Should we have separate page for community runs and goals? Is there a hierarchy in it?

5. What we should show in user profile page when user is part of community run and also has individual goals?

6. Can a user join multiple community runs at some point in time?
